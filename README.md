PNet
====

Networking middleware for unity using Lidgren, with a custom dedicated server.

This library uses Lidgren and Slimmath, with some recommended patches to work with unity. SVN patch files are included, as well as svn repo addresses. You will need to check out both of these repos, as well as patch them. Instructions are included in an additional text file.


The PNet.dll and PNetU.dll should be copied to a Plugins folder in unity. PNet and PNetS are for the server.
